# Python_Class_Inheritance
This is a deep example of Python Class Inhertience with the usage of generators and understanding the hierarchy of classes inherited

What we have in this:
1. We've got a data structure, a grade book. Inside of it, we have a set of classes. Notice how I'm storing them. 
2. We have a list of the students. Those are the classes and I have associated with that a dictionary that, by ID number, lets me retrieve information about each student.
